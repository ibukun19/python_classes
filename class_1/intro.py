# ALGORITHMS 
# An algorithm is a step by step procedure for solving a problem or performing a given computational
# E.g
# 1. Put Rice in Pot
# 2. Add water to the pot 
# 3. Put it on gas
# 4. Turn the gas on to cook.

# Course Objectives :
# 1. At the end of this course you should be able understand do basic debugging and writing of programs with Python 
# 2. At the end of this course you should be able Build a fullstack Python web application
# 3. At the end of this course you should be able Build a python/Django API 

# Understanding the Web 

# What is the Web?
# The Web is global network of content hosted or stored on computers and other devices.

# What is the Internet?

# The internet is the global network of devices; computers,smarttvs, smartwrist watches

# PYTHON

# Is used for game development
# Is used for mobile development
# Is used for desktop app development
# Is used for Data Science 
# Is used for Robotics

# PYTHON For Web Development
# Python is used for Backend Development

# Who is a Backend Developer

# A backend dev is a programmer who writes program logic that controls data access, storage , generation, and modification 
# in an application.

# Major tasks of a Backend Dev

# Key-word here - API = Application Programming Interface

# 1. Writes clean backend code.
# 2. Builds APIs.
# 3. Creates Database and Manages DBs.
# 4. Testing and Debugging apps.
# 5. Authentication and Web Security.
# 6. Server Management.
# 7. Search Engine Optimization SEO.

# Python Variables 

# What are variables ?

# A variable is container for storing data types

# Every single statement of code can categorized under any of 3 groups
# 1. Data creation
# 2. Data modification
# 3. Data transfer
# 4. Data Display

# C- Create
# 
# R- Read
# 
# U- Upadate/put
# 
# D -Delete 

user_name = "Lola Alakija" # Data creation

user_list = []  # Data creation
user_list.append(user_name) # Data transfer and Modification

print(user_list ) # Data display


# Rules for Creating Variables Python

# 1. Python is case sensitive i.e myList is not same  as my_list
# 2. A variable must begin with a letter or underscore but never with a number
# 3. A variable must only contain alpha-numeric chars and underscore .Don't use e.g $, % 
# 4. A variable name connot be an in-built python function e.g print, list, tuple , dictionary, bool etc

# PYTHON DATA TYPES 
    # PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
# 1. Integers - any number between -infinity to + infinity e.g  99
# 2. Strings - any character enclosed in double or single quotes e.g 'good' , "Python lang"
# 3. Floats - any number with a decimal e.g 3.5, 2.1490987
# 4. Boolean - True or False

# Python Data Structures

# Storing Population

nig_population = 200E6
country = "Nigeria"
dollar_price = 1499.98
check_light = True

stud_name = "Opeyemi Badmus"
stud_age = 21

# Data Structures help to organize and store related data in collections

# 1. List
# 2. Tuple
# 3. Sets
# 4. Dictionary
